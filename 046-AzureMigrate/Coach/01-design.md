## Notes and Guidance

- Approximate duration: 1 hour
- Make participants develop a design for your target architecture in Azure and a plan for migrating the on-premises workload
- Use this opportunity to talk a bit about landing zones
- Ensure they're doing an IaaS lift & shift not something whacky involving App Service, AKS, Azure Functions, etc
- Verify they're planning on using Azure Migrate not ASR
- They should discuss the agent-based vs the agent-less approach
- They should evaluate whether multi-region is required
- In the identity discussion, AAD Connect might play a role
