[< Previous Challenge](./00-lab_setup.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./02-discovery.md)

## Description

Plan how to perform the migration

## Success Criteria

Decide these aspects of the migration, taking into account that at this point some are just theoretical questions, since they might not be relevant or applicable in this hack:

- Which workloads to be rehosted, refactored, replatformed, rearchitected or rebuilt?
- Other tools that could be used to migrate specific workloads?
- Has the landing zone been already design and implemented?
    - For example, IP addresses are going to be maintained, or they are going to be changed when moving to Azure?
- Domain Controllers are going to be replicated, or created from scratch?)
- Which factors are going to influence migration waves?
