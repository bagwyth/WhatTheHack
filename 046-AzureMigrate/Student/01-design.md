[< Previous Challenge](./00-lab_setup.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./02-discovery.md)

## Description

Explore the topology deployed.

## Success Criteria

In this hack we are going to use Azure Migrate. Discuss other Azure tools to migrate:

- Virtual machines
- Web applications
- Databases

Decide these aspects of the migration:

- IP addresses are going to be maintained, or they are going to be changed
- Domain Controllers are going to be replicated, or created from scratch
- Which factors are going to influence migration waves
